### Description

This code is the result of me trying to play around and figure out WebGPU and WGSL. I'm trying to figure out the differences and upgrades between GLSL/WGSL WebGL/WebGPU.

### Conclusion;

The compute shaders are ðŸ’‹ðŸ’‹ðŸ’‹.

### How to run the game?

#### TLDR; double click the index.html file

To run the game double click the `index.html` file, or open it with up to date Chrome or Mozila.
It seems that there is no need for server boilerplate to serve this file as I didn't run into any restrictions when opening it with double click, although some browser restrict JS context of `.html` files opened up with dbl click.
If your default browser doesnt support WebGPU API e.g. `Brave` you wont be able to view the game.
